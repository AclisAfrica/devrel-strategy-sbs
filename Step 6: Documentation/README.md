##### 1. Documentation [2h]

This is the final step. It's incredibly important however. You can do this alone or as a team. The task is to pull all documentation created into an overall strategy document/folder. This will serve as a clear reference point to the team and all involved stakeholders.

This document will be invaluable to keeping you goal-oriented and it will give you a baseline to compare your progress to after and during the next quarter(s). This resource should be as accessible as possible to everyone in the organization.

An outline template is provided in [outline-template.md](outline-template.md).
