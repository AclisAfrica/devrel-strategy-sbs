##### 1. Team map [30 min]

Who does what? Where is everyone based? Which languages do they know (human and programming)? What work do they enjoy? Have everyone create a brief introduction on themselves of the form [personal-intro-template.md](personal-intro-template.md) and collect these in the team Jira/Google Drive/Repository.

##### 2. Initiative review [2-5h]

If you have joined an existing team, chances are there are many initiatives/projects that are going on. These may or may not be documented and you may or may not know about them. This exercise aims to create a common understanding of the initiatives that are owned by your team.

1. Give everyone a stack of post-its and brainstorm for 10 minutes. Write down an initiative per post it (e.g. the blog, student hackathons, student ambassador program etc.)

2. Take the next 10 minutes to create a list of all initiatives from the gathered post its.

3. Take each item on the initiative list and create an initiative overview for it. A template for this can be found in [initiative-template.md](initiative-template.md). If your team is big you can split into subgroups and draft overviews in parallel. Ensure that everyone has a chance to read and commend on each overview. The goal is to achieve a common ground.
